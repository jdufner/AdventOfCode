## [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/8)

Part 1: Find shortest path to visit all locations. ([NP complete problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness))

Solution idea: Brute force approach
* Full search using a recursive algorithm.
* Termination conditions: all locations visited and all possible path checked

Remark: search duration not considered, since only few locations

Part 2:
